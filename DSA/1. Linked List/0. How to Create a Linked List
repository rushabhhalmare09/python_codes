Linked List: -
Each Element of a Linked List is known as a Node.
How linked list is created, how all the nodes are connected together, so what happens is as we know all the elements are Node, so Node stores two things -> 1] value of its own data and 2] Reference number of next node(or value) which needs to be connected and for the last node reference value stored will be NULL.
Reference of the first element is stored and known as Head and Reference of the Last Element is known as Tail.
data   stores value of current node
next   stores Reference of Next Node. 

Creating a Linked List: - 

1]
Class Node: 
    
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

#Creating an Object and passing argument here assigning first value of linked list
a = Node(14)

b = Node(15)

#creating a Linkage between two nodes, here saying that a is first node and assigning b as 2nd node
a.next = b

print(a)
Output: -
14

Print(b)
Output: -
15

nexEl = a.next.data
print(nexEl)
Output: -
15   (here 15 bcz as we know next stores reference of next node so a.next contains the reference of b ‘s data, hence it is pointing to b so value of b is printed)

2] Create a Linked List created by taking input from user

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data=data
        self.next=None

    def takeInput():
        #Taking Input from user space separated and -1 needs to be given by user to end
        inputList=[int (ele) for ele in input(“Enter space separated values and at last -1”).split()]
        #Initialization of Head to be None 
        head=None
        #Running a for loop to iterate over the input provided by user and storing in currData
        for currData in inputList:
            #Giving stop condition once -1 is received, directly go to last line and return head
            if currData==-1:
                break
            #If not -1, then creating an object of class Node and passing argument value of 1st Node
            newNode=Node(currData)

            #If it is very First Value, then as have initialized head to be Node this condition will be met and head will become the first value user provided and it will go again to for loop
            if head is None:
                head=newNode
            else:
                #Once if condition is failed for 2nd value onwards, we will enter to else part and we will set curr equal to head 
                curr=head
                #For 2nd value it won’t go inside while condition as first value’s reference value will be None, so in 2nd value after while loop we are setting reference value to be 2nd values reference value hence in 3rd value it will enter inside while loop, we will change pointing from head to  next node say for 3rd value it will be 2nd value’s reference value, as 2nd values reference value is None it will exit while loop and set 2nd values reference to 3rd value and so on.
                while curr.next is not None:
                    curr=curr.next
     #This will help in changing the reference value from None to next values reference value
                curr.next=newNode

        return head         #Once we reach this condition linked list is created and we return head


3] Using tail -- Optimizing Creation of Linked List to O(n)

#Creating a Node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data=data
        self.next=None

def takeInput():
    #Taking Input from user space separated and -1 needs to be given by user to end
    inputList=[int (ele) for ele in input(“Enter space separated values and at last -1”).split()]
     #Initialization of Head and tail to be None    
     head=None
     tail=None
   #Running a for loop to iterate over the input provided by user and storing in currData
    for currData in inputList:
        if currData==-1:
            break
        #If not -1, then creating an object of class Node and passing argument value of 1st Node basically creating a New Node
        newNode=Node(currData)

        #If it is very First Value, then as have initialized head and tail to be Node this condition will be met and head and tail will become the first value user provided and it will be going to top again for loop
        if head is None:
            head=newNode
            tail=newNode

        else:
            #For 2nd value onwards, if condition will fail as head is not None hence tail.next  i.e reference value of 2nd value will become 2nd value
            tail.next=newNode
            #here, tail will be assigned the newNode value 
            tail=newNode
    return head      #Once we reach this condition linked list is created and we return head

#Printing a Linked List
def printLL(head):
    while head is not None:
        print(str(head.data)+"->",end='')
        # after printing the value Incrementing the data so that the next time it again comes in while loop the value will change
        head=head.next
    print("None")
    return

#Creating an object of class takeInput
head=takeInput()

#Print the Linked list
printLL(head)



============
The Midpoint of A Linked List
The Trivial Approach- Two Passes
● This approach requires us to traverse through the linked list twice i.e. 2
passes.
● In the first pass, we will calculate the ​length​ of the linked list. After every
iteration, update the​ length​ variable.
● In the second pass, we will find the element of the linked list at the
(length-1)/2​th position. This element shall be the middle element in the
linked list.
● However, we wish to traverse the linked list only once, therefore let us see
another approach.
The Optimal Approach- One Pass
● The midpoint of a linked list can be found out very easily by taking two
pointers, one named ​slow ​and the other named ​fast​.
● As their names suggest, they will move in the same way respectively.
● The ​fast​ pointer will move ahead ​two pointers at a time​, while the​ slow
pointer one will move at a speed of ​a pointer at a time​.
● In this way, when the fast pointer will reach the end, by that time the slow
pointer will be at the middle position of the array.
● These pointers will be updated like this:
○ slow = slow.next
○ fast = fast.next.next

Python Code
Note:
● For odd length there will be only one middle element, but for the even length
there will be two middle elements.
● In case of an even length LL, both these approaches, will return the ​first
middle element​ and the other one will be the direct ​next ​of the first middle
element.
Merge Two sorted linked lists
● We will be merging the linked list, similar to the way we performed merge
over two sorted arrays.
● We will be using the two ​head​ pointers, compare their data and the one
found smaller will be directed to the new linked list, and increase the ​head
pointer of the corresponding linked list.
● Just remember to maintain the ​head​ pointer separately for the new sorted
list.
● And also if one of the linked list’s length ends and the other one’s not, then
the remaining linked list will directly be appended to the final list.
● Try to implement this approach on your own.

def printMiddle(headNode):
if headNode is None or headNode.next is None:
return head
slow = headNode #Slow pointer
fast = headNode.next #Fast Pointer
while (fast is not None and fast.next is not None):
fast = fast.next.next
slow = slow.next
return slow #Slow pointer shall point to our middle element
Mergesort over a linked list
● Like the merge sort algorithm is applied over the arrays, the same way we
will be applying it over the linked list.
● Just the difference is that in the case of arrays, the middle element could be
easily figured out, but here you have to find the middle element, each time
you send the linked list to split into two halves using the above approach.
● The merging part of the divided lists can also be done using the ​merge
sorted linked lists code ​as discussed above.
● The functionalities of this code have already been implemented by you, just
use them directly in your functions at the specified places.
● Try to implement this approach on your own.
Reverse the linked list
Recursive approach:
● In this approach, we will store the last element of the list in the small answer,
and then update that by adding the​ next last node​ and so on.
● Finally, when we will be reaching the first element, we will assign the ​next​ to
NONE.
● Follow the Python code below, for better understanding.

def reverseLinkedList(head) :
 if head is None or head.next is None
 return head
 smallHead = reverseLinkedList(head.next)
 head.next.next head
 head.next = None
 return smallHead
After calculation, you can see that this code has a time complexity of ​O(n​2
)​. Now
let’s think about how to improve it.
